<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About the project

This project helps real estate development companies that encompass activities that range from the renovation and re-lease of existing buildings to the purchase of raw land and the sale of developed land or parcels to others. 
As real estate developers are the people and companies who coordinate all of these activities, converting ideas from paper to real property, "Build your home, own your future, simulates how a page of a real stater would work if they offer to the buyers the possibility to see de development or progress in the construction of their properties. As they buy them on a pre-sale.
This app allows the client to see how are their investments, and to the companie to offer a plus over their sells.
