<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
This project helps real estate development companies that encompass activities that range from the renovation and re-lease of existing buildings to the purchase of raw land and sale of developed land or parcels to others.
Since a real estate developers are the people and companies who coordinate all of these activities, converting ideas from paper to real property, "Build your home, own your future", simulates how a page of a real stater would work if they offer to buyers the possibility to see the development or progress in the construction of their properties while they buy them on a pre-sale.
This app allows the client to see how their investments are, and offers to the companie a plus over their sells.
