    <h4>Why is better to invest in your home in a real state development?</h4>
    <p>Strong economic and demographic growth has combined to create a significant and increasing demand for rental housing in urban Mexico. However, there is currently little supply of purpose-built, professionally managed multifamily rental housing.

These factors present a compelling opportunity to invest in the development of a large, high-quality portfolio of multifamily rental housing properties throughout Mexico's major urban markets. Gran Ciudad was created to capitalize on this opportunity.

We are a fully integrated company managed by a multidisciplinary team of experienced professionals. We directly manage the development and operation of our properties through our in-house development and property management groups. And, we capitalize our property investments through the institutional funds and other investment vehicles that we manage.

We take a disciplined and research-based approach to investing and developing in high-quality locations. We are presently focused on growing our portfolio within Mexico City. Our business plan includes expanding to other key urban markets in the near future.

We create communities where residents feel at home, gather with friends and family, and enjoy daily routines and interactions with neighbors. Our properties include thoughtfully designed apartments, lifestyle amenities and curated retail experiences.

With an exceptional team and a well-defined strategy, we are working to create long-term value for our residents, investors, business partners and employees.</p>
